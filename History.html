<h1 style="text-align:center">History of Pavlodar</h1>
<p>One of the oldest cities in northern Kazakhstan, Pavlodar was founded in 1720 as Koryakovsky fort, an Imperial Russian outpost. The settlement was created to establish control over the region's salt lakes, an important source of valuable salt. In 1861 the settlement was renamed Pavlodar and incorporated as a town. Pavlodar's significance was due in large measure to the substantial agricultural and salt-producing industries that had developed there despite the town's relatively small population. Pavlodar's population numbered only about 8,000 in 1897. The name Pavlodar means The Gift of Paul, and was chosen to commemorate the birth of the Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia.After 1955, the Soviet Government's Virgin Lands Campaign provided the impetus for the rapid growth and development of modern Pavlodar. Under the program, large numbers of young men and women from throughout the Soviet Union were relocated to the city; industrial and commercial activity was increased; and from the mid-1960s on, Pavlodar grew to become a major industrial centre of both the Kazakh SSR and of the Soviet Union because of a major arms and armour manufacturing facility located in the city.On April 1 2020, the city was subject to quarantine in an attempt to slow the spread of Covid-19.The population of the city was supposed to be within 230 thousand people. And the master plan for the development of the city, developed by the Lengiprogor Institute, was approved in 1957. In 1968, it was adjusted taking into account new circumstances, and the estimated population was already determined at 380 thousand people.A new hotel "North", a hospital campus (currently - the II city hospital), a construction technical school, a city garden, a hotel "Kazakhstan", a building of the regional party committee are being built in the city. With the organization in Tselinograd of the head design institute "Tselinproekt", its branch is formed in the city, and the staff of this branch develops projects for the buildings of a television center with a 180-meter tower, a tuberculosis dispensary, a new building of a pedagogical school, an administrative building of an industrial institute, the first microdistrict in Pavlodar within the boundaries of the streets Kuibyshev (Toraigyrov), Kutuzov, Lermontov and Korolenko.In 1969, the Kazsevselproject Institute was established, whose employees continued to work on the architectural design of the city.One of the oldest cities in northern Kazakhstan, Pavlodar was founded in 1720 as Koryakovsky fort, an Imperial Russian outpost.
